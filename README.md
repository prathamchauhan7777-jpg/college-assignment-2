# college-assignment-2
This repository contains my weekly Python tasks completed during class from Week 6 to Week 11. Each task was built in Google Colab and pushed to GitHub as part of my progressive portfolio. The goal was to practice core programming concepts, reflect on my process, and explore how AI can support learning.

## Weekly Task Summary

### Week 6 – Contact Book with Dictionaries  
•⁠  ⁠Created a contact book using nested dictionaries.  
•⁠  ⁠Used playful keys like “Ram” and “Bob” to personalize entries.  
•⁠  ⁠Practiced looping through dictionary items for clean output.  
•⁠  ⁠AI helped restructure the data and simplify the loop logic.

### Week 7 – Data Storytelling  
•⁠  ⁠Built a mini data story using markdown and visuals.  
•⁠  ⁠Focused on clarity and flow to guide the reader.  
•⁠  ⁠AI suggested chart types and helped refine the narrative.

### Week 8 – Loops and Control Flow  
•⁠  ⁠Explored ⁠ for ⁠ and ⁠ while ⁠ loops with user input.  
•⁠  ⁠Debugged loop conditions and avoided infinite loops.  
•⁠  ⁠AI helped reframe logic in beginner-friendly terms.

### Week 9 – Functions and Reusability  
•⁠  ⁠Refactored code into modular functions.  
•⁠  ⁠Named functions creatively to match my coding style.  
•⁠  ⁠AI supported parameter handling and edge case testing.

### Week 10 – Contact Book + Process Documentation  
•⁠  ⁠Built a contact book with phone and email fields.  
•⁠  ⁠Documented my design and testing process in a separate notebook.  
•⁠  ⁠AI helped polish markdown explanations and improve formatting.

### Week 11 – Software Testing  
•⁠  ⁠Applied equivalence class and boundary testing.  
•⁠  ⁠Designed test cases for input validation.  
•⁠  ⁠AI helped generate test scenarios and explain coverage strategies.
