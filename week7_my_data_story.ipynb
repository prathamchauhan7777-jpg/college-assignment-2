        "1. A Personal Text File\n",
        "Create a simple text file (.txt) with content of your choice:\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggested options: - Shopping list for this week (10-15 items) - Your goals for this semester (5-10 goals)\n",

        "\"Help me write Python code in a Jupyter notebook that reads a text file and analyzes its contents, including line count, word count, and longest line.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**What the AI Helped Me With:**\n",
        "\"The AI guided me through writing clean and readable code to open a file, display its contents, and calculate useful statistics. It also helped me understand how each function works and how to format the output clearly.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**What I Learned:**\n",
        "\"I learned how to use Python’s built-in file handling tools to extract meaningful information from a text file. Collaborating with AI made it easier to understand the logic behind each step and improved my confidence in writing code independently.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "**What surprised me about working with files:**\n",
        "\"I didn’t expect file handling in Python to be so straightforward. It was interesting to see how quickly I could extract useful information from a simple text file using just a few lines of code.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**How this connects to business:**\n",
        "\" Many businesses rely on data stored in files—whether it's customer feedback, financial records, or inventory lists. Knowing how to access and analyze this data efficiently can help improve decision-making and automate routine tasks.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next thing I want to learn:**\n",
