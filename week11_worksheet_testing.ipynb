        "This worksheet guides you through practical exercises in test specification and verification. You'll practice the core skills from Modules 1-3: writing specifications, designing test strategies, and working with AI to verify code quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
        "- Write clear specifications using assertions\n",
        "- Apply systematic frameworks for test design (Given/When/Then, Equivalence Partitioning)\n",
        "- Make strategic decisions about test adequacy and risk\n",
        "- Evaluate AI-generated code and tests for simplicity and correctness\n",
        "- Practice the Specify → Generate → Verify → Refine cycle\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Role:**\n",
        "You are the **strategic architect**. AI is your implementation assistant. You decide:\n",
        "- What needs testing (and what doesn't)\n",
        "- How comprehensive tests should be\n",
        "- Whether code is simple enough\n",
        "- When to ask AI for improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI-First Approach:**\n",
        "We focus on \"specify and verify\" rather than manual coding. You'll learn to clearly communicate requirements to AI, then critically evaluate results."

        "- Can a beginner understand this?\n",

        "- Does it use only basic Python constructs?\n",
        "Yes. It relies on if statements, string methods, and a for loop—no advanced syntax or libraries.\n",
        "- Is there a simpler approach?\n",
        "Possibly. The loop could be replaced with separate loops or condition checks using only if statements, which might be even more beginner-friendly.\n",
        "3. Did you find any bugs or issues?\n",
        "No bugs were found. The logic is sound, and all rules are enforced correctly. However, it assumes the input is a string. If there's a chance of receiving non-string input, a type check could be added.\n",
        "4. Test Coverage:\n",
        "- Are there scenarios you didn’t test?\n",
        "Yes. You didn’t test inputs like None, numbers, or mixed types. You also didn’t test passwords with only uppercase letters and digits but no special characters.\n",
        "- Are they worth testing (risk vs. effort)?\n",
        "Yes, if the function is exposed to user input directly. Otherwise, if input validation is handled elsewhere, it’s reasonable to leave them out.\n",
        "- Decision: Add tests if input type is uncertain. Otherwise, leave as-is.\n",
