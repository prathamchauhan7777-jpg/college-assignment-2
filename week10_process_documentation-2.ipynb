        "You work at a Perth restaurant. The manager wants a simple tool where staff can enter: - The bill amount (e.g., $45.80) - The tip percentage (e.g., 15%)\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This program will help restaurant staff to calculate the tip and the total bill. The staff will input the amount of the bill and the percentage of the tip they want to give and based on these inputs, the tool will compute the tip amount and the final total, which includes the bill and tip together.\n",

        "STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "INPUTS: - The user provides the total bill amount and the tip percentage they want to apply.\n",
        " - Both inputs are numbers. The bill amount is a decimal number, and the tip percentage is typically a whole number.\n",
        "\n",
        "OUTPUTS: - The program will show two things, the tip amount and the total amount to charge(bill + tip).\n",
        "Both outputs are shown as currency values, usually with two decimal places (e.g., $6.87, $52.67).\n",

        "\n",
        "Write the steps: 1. We will calculate the tip by multiplying the bill amount by the tip percentage.\n",
        "tip = 45.80*(15/100)=45.80 * 0.15= 6.87\n",
        "So, the tip amount is $6.87.\n",
