Week 10: Show Me Your Process
Two Simple Problems - Steps 1-3 Only

1 Weekly Exercise: Show Me Your Process

What You Submit: Just Steps 1, 2, and 3 for two problems. NO CODE.

This week is about proving you can THINK about a problem before jumping to AI or code.

1.1 Problem 1: Tip Calculator

1.1.1 The Scenario
You work at a Perth restaurant. The manager wants a simple tool where staff can enter:

The bill amount (e.g., $45.80)
The tip percentage (e.g., 15%)
And get back:

The tip amount
The total amount to charge
1.1.2 What You Must Submit
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

In your own words, what is this program supposed to do? (2-3 sentences)

[Your answer here]

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS:

[What does the user provide?]
[What type of data? Numbers? Text?]
OUTPUTS:

[What does the program show back?]
[What format?]
STEP 3: Work It By Hand

Show me you can do this with a calculator. Use this example:

Bill amount: $45.80
Tip percentage: 15%
Write the steps:

[First calculation I would do]
[Second calculation]
[Final step]
[What I would tell the staff member]
1.2 Problem 2: Late Fee Calculator

1.2.1 The Scenario
You work for a library in Perth. Books are due back in 14 days. For every day late, there’s a $0.50 fine (maximum $10.00).

The librarian wants a program where they enter:

How many days the book is overdue
And get back:

The fine amount (or “Maximum fine reached” if it’s over $10)
1.2.2 What You Must Submit
STEP 1: Understand the Problem

In your own words, what is this program supposed to do? (2-3 sentences)

[Your answer here]

STEP 2: Identify Inputs and Outputs

INPUTS:

[What information does the librarian provide?]
OUTPUTS:

[What does the program calculate and show?]
[Any special cases?]
STEP 3: Work It By Hand

Show me you understand the logic. Calculate these three cases manually:

Case A: Book is 5 days late

My calculation: [Show your work]
Fine: [Answer]
Case B: Book is 25 days late

My calculation: [Show your work]
Fine: [Answer]
Special note: [Why is this different?]
Case C: Book is 0 days late

Fine: [Answer]
1.3 Submission Requirements

Create a Google Colab notebook
Use markdown cells to answer all the questions above
Export your AI conversation (if you used AI to check your thinking)
Save as AI_conversation.txt
Add to your GitHub repo
Save to GitHub with commit message: “Week 10 - Process documentation”
NO CODE REQUIRED

1.3.1 About Using AI
You SHOULD use AI to:

Check if your manual calculations are correct
Verify your understanding of the problem
Ask “did I identify all the inputs?”
But your submitted answers must be in YOUR words, showing YOUR thinking.

1.4 Marking

Each problem is marked Complete/Incomplete:

Complete: All three steps answered with genuine effort + AI conversation file in repo (if used)
Incomplete: Missing steps, one-word answers, or no evidence of checking work
1.5 What I’m Looking For

✅ Good Answer (Step 1): “This program helps restaurant staff calculate tips quickly. They type in the bill amount and what percentage tip they want to add, and the program tells them the tip amount and the new total.”

❌ Lazy Answer:

“Calculate tips.”

✅ Good Answer (Step 3 - Tip Calculator):

Take $45.80 and multiply by 0.15 to get the tip: $6.87
Add $6.87 to $45.80 to get the total: $52.67
Tell the staff member: “Tip is $6.87, total charge is $52.67”
❌ Lazy Answer:

“Calculate 15% and add it.”

1.6 Why No Code This Week?

Because I’m testing whether you can THINK about problems, not whether you can get AI to write code for you.

If you can’t do Steps 1-3, then you don’t understand the problem well enough to use AI effectively anyway.
